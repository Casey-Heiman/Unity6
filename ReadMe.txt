I was not able to fix the problem of the score counting towards both players when one jumps over the other as I dont have copilot and I spent alot of time trying to fix it and couldn't. Because of this i couldn't add the game design tools of goals and strategy i wanted, which will be when one player touches the other 5 times the opponent dies and when a player hits a trap item they lose a point.
